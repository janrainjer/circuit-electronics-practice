# Linear Algebra - Project
Elementary Differential Equations and Linear Algebra (01076032), Computer Engineering 60 at KMITL.

- The project aims to predict the risk of developing lung cancer. By examining and analyzing data patterns divided into age, gender, and various symptoms that are risk factors for lung cancer, for example, smoking, allergies, anxiety, coughing, drinking alcohol, etc., together with the use of mathematical principles such as **Pearson's** **Similarity**, **Logistic** **Regression**, **and** **Confusion** **Matrix** to apply the above data formats. to process together This is one of the tools that can help you decide to detect lung cancer and provide timely treatment.

  > **Keywords**: Lung cancer, Risk prediction, Logistic Regression
